📊 Data Science Internship – February 2026
🧠 Logic Building Task – 1
📌 Project Overview

This repository contains the complete implementation of Logic Building Task – 1, assigned as part of the Data Science Internship – February 2026.

The purpose of this task is to strengthen foundational Python programming, logical reasoning, and structured problem-solving through a set of real-world inspired mini problems.

All solutions are implemented using clean, modular, and well-documented Python code in Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab format.

🎯 Objectives

Strengthen logical thinking and reasoning

Practice conditional statements and loops

Perform basic data preprocessing

Implement structured, function-based programming

Write clean, readable, and maintainable code

Follow proper documentation standards

📝 Tasks Implemented
✅ 1. User Login Check

Problem Statement
Validate a username and password against predefined credentials.

username = "admin"
password = "1234"


Requirements

Print "Login Successful" if both credentials match

Otherwise print "Invalid Credentials"

Concepts Used

Conditional statements (if-else)

Logical operators (and)

Function-based implementation

Real-World Application
Authentication systems used in websites, enterprise portals, and applications.

✅ 2. Pass / Fail Analyzer

Problem Statement
Analyze student results.

marks = [45, 78, 90, 33, 60]


Requirements

Student passes if marks ≥ 50

Count total pass students

Count total fail students

Print structured summary

Concepts Used

Loops

Conditional logic

Aggregation using sum()

Dictionary-based output

Real-World Application
Academic result processing systems and performance dashboards.

✅ 3. Simple Data Cleaner

Problem Statement
Clean and standardize user names.

names = [" Alice ", "bob", " CHARLIE "]


Requirements

Remove extra spaces

Convert names to lowercase

Print cleaned list

Concepts Used

String methods (strip(), lower())

List comprehension

Real-World Application
Data preprocessing before analytics and machine learning.

✅ 4. Message Length Analyzer

Problem Statement
Analyze message sizes.

messages = ["Hi", "Welcome to the platform", "OK"]


Requirements

Print length of each message

Flag messages longer than 10 characters

Concepts Used

len() function

Conditional checks

Structured output formatting

Real-World Application
Text validation systems and content filtering mechanisms.

✅ 5. Error Message Detector

Problem Statement
Detect error messages from system logs.

logs = ["INFO", "ERROR", "WARNING", "ERROR"]


Requirements

Count number of "ERROR" entries

Print total error count

Concepts Used

List method count()

Basic log pattern analysis

Real-World Application
Monitoring tools and production log analysis systems.
